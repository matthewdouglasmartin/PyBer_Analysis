# PyBer_Analysis
Using Matplotlib to create visualizations for analysis
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

Initially the ride-sharing company PyBer, was interested in an analysis of its company data in order to better understand how its riders, drivers, fares, and city types were related.  Analysis was conducted on these metrics and their relationships to each other in an effort to help PyBer imporove two main components of its business model: access and affordability. In addition, the team at PyBer requested a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type and multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each city type.  This last portion of analysis provided was then used to draw conclusions regarding decisions PyBer can make to positively impact any opportunities from the analysis provided.  

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

In order to conduct analysis on how the ride-sharing data differed based on the city type, a summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart were created from the data provided by PyBer.  The summary DataFrame provides the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver per city type.  There are three main city types used to organize the data: rural, suburban, and urban.  The multiple-line chart visualizes the total fares per week by city type for four month period in 2019.  These two visualizations should be used in conjunction with each when performing analysis because each provide additional insight for the data the ther provides.  



## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
